# Linear Algebra

This directory contains work on linear algebra, focused mostly on manipulation
of vectors and matrices. Key properties and operations include

- The shape of a matrix is defined by its row and column dimensions.
- Slicing entails extracting specific parts of vectors or matrices.
- Element-wise operations involve performing arithmetic on corresponding elements.
- Concatenation combines vectors or matrices along specific axes.
- The dot product results from multiplying corresponding elements and summing.
- Matrix multiplication combines matrices following specific rules.
- Transposing a matrix involves switching its rows and columns. 


`Numpy`, a Python library, aids in efficient numerical operations. Parallelization accelerates computations through simultaneous execution, and broadcasting simplifies operations on arrays with different shapes. 


Understanding these concepts is essential for various applications, including machine learning.
